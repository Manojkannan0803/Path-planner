# CATALYST Algorithms Package - Algorithm Layer
"""
This package implements the Algorithm Layer of the XX (work)-inspired architecture.

This package contains path planning algorithms converted from MATLAB, including:
- A* Path Planning (from Pathplanning_Astar.m)
- Cost Calculators (from g_cost.m, h_cost.m)  
- Collision Detection (from staticobs_check.m)

All algorithms follow the XX (work) plugin architecture pattern.
